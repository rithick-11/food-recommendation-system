A Role-Based Personalized Food Recommendation System with Administrative Approval Workflow for Healthcare Applications

ABSTRACT

This paper presents a comprehensive web-based food recommendation system designed specifically for healthcare environments, featuring a novel three-tier role-based access control system with administrative approval workflows. The system addresses the critical need for personalized nutrition management in clinical settings by implementing distinct user roles (patients, doctors, and administrators) with appropriate access controls and approval mechanisms. The platform integrates patient health profiles, dietary preferences, and medical conditions to generate personalized meal recommendations while ensuring data security and professional oversight through a structured approval process for healthcare providers.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background
The increasing prevalence of diet-related health conditions has highlighted the need for personalized nutrition management systems in healthcare settings. Traditional approaches to dietary counseling often lack the scalability and consistency required for modern healthcare environments. Digital food recommendation systems offer a promising solution by providing personalized, evidence-based dietary guidance while maintaining professional oversight.

1.2 Problem Statement
Existing food recommendation systems typically focus on general consumer preferences rather than medical requirements and lack the structured oversight necessary for healthcare applications. Key challenges include:
• Absence of role-based access control for healthcare environments
• Lack of administrative approval workflows for healthcare providers
• Limited integration of medical conditions with dietary recommendations
• Insufficient data security measures for patient health information

1.3 Contributions
This paper presents the following key contributions:
1. A novel three-tier role-based access control system (Patient-Doctor-Administrator)
2. An administrative approval workflow for healthcare provider verification
3. Integration of medical conditions and dietary preferences in recommendation algorithms
4. Secure patient data management with professional oversight capabilities
5. A scalable web-based architecture suitable for healthcare institutions

2. RELATED WORK

2.1 Food Recommendation Systems
Previous research in food recommendation systems has primarily focused on collaborative filtering and content-based approaches for general consumer applications. However, these systems lack the medical oversight and security requirements necessary for healthcare environments.

2.2 Healthcare Information Systems
Role-based access control in healthcare systems has been extensively studied, but its application to nutrition management systems remains limited. Our work bridges this gap by implementing healthcare-grade access controls in a nutrition-focused application.

2.3 Personalized Nutrition
Recent advances in personalized nutrition have emphasized the importance of individual health profiles in dietary recommendations. Our system extends this concept by incorporating professional medical oversight into the recommendation process.

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

3.1 Overall Architecture
The system follows a three-tier architecture:
• Presentation Layer: React.js-based responsive web interface
• Application Layer: Node.js/Express.js backend with role-based middleware
• Data Layer: MongoDB database with secure patient data storage

3.2 Role-Based Access Control Model

3.2.1 Patient Role
• Create and manage personal health profiles
• View personalized meal recommendations
• Update dietary preferences and restrictions
• Access personal meal plan history

3.2.2 Doctor Role (Requires Administrative Approval)
• View and manage multiple patient profiles
• Generate meal plans for assigned patients
• Access patient meal plan history
• Update patient medical information

3.2.3 Administrator Role
• Approve/reject doctor registration requests
• Monitor system usage and user activities
• Manage user roles and permissions
• Oversee data security and compliance

3.3 Administrative Approval Workflow
The system implements a novel approval workflow for healthcare providers:

1. Registration: Doctors register with professional credentials
2. Pending Status: New doctor accounts are marked as "pending approval"
3. Administrative Review: Administrators review credentials and approve/reject applications
4. Access Control: Only approved doctors can access patient data
5. Notification System: Automated notifications for status changes

4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 Backend Implementation
• Framework: Node.js with Express.js
• Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
• Authentication: JWT-based authentication with role-based middleware
• Security: bcrypt password hashing, input validation, and sanitization

4.2 Frontend Implementation
• Framework: React.js with modern hooks and context API
• State Management: Zustand for efficient state management
• Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
• Routing: React Router for single-page application navigation

4.3 Database Schema Design

4.3.1 User Model
{
  name: String,
  email: String (unique),
  password: String (hashed),
  role: Enum ['patient', 'doctor', 'admin'],
  approvalStatus: Enum ['pending', 'approved', 'rejected'],
  timestamps: Date
}

4.3.2 Patient Profile Model
{
  user: ObjectId (ref: User),
  age: Number,
  height_cm: Number,
  weight_kg: Number,
  bloodPressure: String,
  bloodGroup: String,
  medicalSummary: String,
  diseaseCondition: String,
  mealPreference: Enum ['Vegetarian', 'Non-Vegetarian', 'Mixed'],
  allergies: [String],
  dislikedItems: [String],
  activityLevel: Enum ['Sedentary', 'Lightly Active', 'Moderately Active', 'Very Active'],
  healthGoal: Enum ['Weight Loss', 'Weight Maintenance', 'Muscle Gain', 'Manage Condition']
}

4.4 API Design
The system implements RESTful APIs with role-based access control:

• Authentication Endpoints: /api/auth/*
• Patient Endpoints: /api/profile/* (Patient access)
• Doctor Endpoints: /api/patients/* (Approved doctor access)
• Admin Endpoints: /api/admin/* (Administrator access)
• Meal Plan Endpoints: /api/mealplan/* (Role-specific access)

5. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

5.1 Authentication and Authorization
• JWT-based stateless authentication
• Role-based middleware for endpoint protection
• Approval status verification for doctor access

5.2 Data Protection
• Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
• Input validation and sanitization
• CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

5.3 Access Control Matrix

Resource               | Patient | Doctor (Pending) | Doctor (Approved) | Administrator
Own Profile           | CRUD    | Read             | Read              | Read
Patient Profiles      | -       | -                | CRUD              | Read
